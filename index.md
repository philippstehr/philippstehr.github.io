# Philipp Stehr

I am a political philosopher working on the political theory of the economic sphere. I am currently working on two main research projects. The first is concerned with what a commitment to democracy means for economic institutions. The second is a project on political resistance, again with a particular focus on the economic sphere. Besides these two projects I have some broader research interests in business ethics and political philosophy, working on issues like workers' rights.
I pursue my research in the spirit of realism and with a special concern for empirical grounding. I strive to clarify abstract normative claims through their application to real examples and through spelling out their meaning in real life.

I am currently a postdoc [at the Munich School of Politics and Public Policy](https://www.hfp.tum.de/en/theory/team/). Until July 2025 I was a fixed-term lecturer [at Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/staff/PHStehr) where I previously did my PhD and was part of the [Corporatocracy project](https://businesscorporation.sites.uu.nl/). I did my BA in Philosophy in Frankfurt and an interdisciplinary MA in "Ethics - Economics, Law and Politics" in Bochum. You can find my full CV [here](https://philippstehr.github.io/CV.pdf).

## Dissertation project

I wrote my dissertation on the democratization of business corporations. Business corporations hold an enormous amount of power towards employees, contractors, customers, and the general public without any democratic control. This runs contrary to basic democratic convictions, so the democratization of business corporations is called for. In my thesis I explore several questions related to this project of democratization. What exactly does it mean to democratize a business corporation? Who should be involved and what kinds of institutional changes are democratic? How can we develop feasible institutional proposals for democratic business corporations? What are feasible institutional proposals and what does 'feasible' even mean in the context of such a fundamental change to our economic infrastructure?

## Teaching

In the summer term 2025 I'll be co-teaching a course on democratic innovations at TU Munich. In the Academic Year 2024/25 I've also been teaching a range of graduate and undergraduate courses in the Philosophy, PPE, and Applied Ethics programs at Utrecht.

In 2022 and 2023 I have co-taught an Introduction to Political Philosophy for undergraduate PPE students at Utrecht.

From 2018 to 2020 I was a research and teaching assistant for a range of courses at Ruhr-University Bochum, including an introductory lecture on Ethics and graduate seminars on legitimacy, Kant, a Univeral Basic Income, and other topics in political philosophy.
