# Philipp Stehr

I am a researcher working in ethics and political philosophy. Much of my work is motivated by the question what a commitment to democracy means for the design of economic institutions. For instance, how do basic political rights bear on what business corporations should look like? This interest has lead me to work on a variety of topics like labour rights, strikes, expropriation, and workplace democracy.

I am currently working on two main research projects. The first is concerned with developing some of the institutional details of workplace democracy. If we accept that employees should have more of a say at work, what exactly should those more democratic workplaces look like? The second is a project on political resistance, again with a particular focus on the economic sphere. If we think that economic institutions are flawed in certain ways (unjust, undemocratic, etc.), what are citizens morally permitted to do about it?

One important commitment in my pursuit of these research projects is a special concern for empirical grounding. I strive to clarify abstract normative claims through their application to real examples and through spelling out their meaning in real life, closely integrating case studies as well as results from empirical social science.

I am currently a postdoc [at the Munich School of Politics and Public Policy](https://www.hfp.tum.de/en/theory/team/) and a founding lab member of the [Democratic Innovations Lab at the TUM Think Tank](https://tumthinktank.de/en/project/democratic-innovations-lab/). Until July 2025 I was a fixed-term lecturer [at Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/ethics-institute) where I previously did my PhD and was part of the [Corporatocracy project](https://businesscorporation.sites.uu.nl/). I did my BA in Philosophy in Frankfurt and an interdisciplinary MA in "Ethics - Economics, Law and Politics" in Bochum. You can find my full CV [here](https://philippstehr.github.io/CV.pdf).

## Dissertation

I wrote my dissertation on the democratization of business corporations. Business corporations hold an enormous amount of power towards employees, contractors, customers, and the general public without any democratic control. This runs contrary to basic democratic convictions, so the democratization of business corporations is called for. In my thesis I explore several questions related to this project of democratization. What exactly does it mean to democratize a business corporation? Who should be involved and what kinds of institutional changes are democratic? How can we develop feasible institutional proposals for democratic business corporations? What are feasible institutional proposals and what does 'feasible' even mean in the context of such a fundamental change to our economic infrastructure?

## Teaching

Since the fall term 2025/6 I am teaching introductory and advanced courses in political philosophy and ethics in the BA Political Science and the MA Politics & Technology at TUM. 

In the summer term 2025 I taught a course on democratic innovations at TU Munich. In the Academic Year 2024/25 I've also been teaching a range of graduate and undergraduate courses in the Philosophy, PPE, and Applied Ethics programs at Utrecht. In 2022 and 2023 I have co-taught an Introduction to Political Philosophy for undergraduate PPE students at Utrecht.

From 2018 to 2020 I was a research and teaching assistant for a range of courses at Ruhr-University Bochum, including an introductory lecture on Ethics and graduate seminars on legitimacy, Kant, a Univeral Basic Income, and other topics in political philosophy.

Students can find some basic tips for studying philosophy [here](https://philippstehr.github.io/StudentResources.html).
