# Philipp Stehr

I am a political philosopher broadly interested in the economy and economics. I am currently writing a dissertation at Utrecht University on business corporations and democracy. I have a secondary research interest in early Max Horkheimer, especially his methodological writings.

Before coming to Utrecht I did my BA in Philosophy in Frankfurt and an interdisciplinary MA in "Ethics - Economics, Law and Politics" in Bochum.

In case you are at a conference where I am giving a talk, you can find my slides [here](https://philippstehr.github.io/presentations/Presentation_Braga_slides.pdf).

## Dissertation project

Business corporations hold an enormous amount of power towards employees, contractors, customers, and the general public without any democratic control. This runs contrary to basic democratic convictions, so the democratization of business corporations is called for. In my thesis I explore several questions related to this project of democratization. What exactly does it mean to democratize a business corporation? Who should be involved and what kinds of institutional changes are democratic? How can we develop feasible institutional proposals for democratic business corporations? What are feasible institutional proposals and what does 'feasible' even mean in the context of such a fundamental change to our economic infrastructure?

## Teaching

In 2022 and 2023 I have taught an Introduction to Political Philosophy for PPE students at Utrecht.

From 2018 to 2020 I was a research and teaching assistant for a range of courses including an introductory lecture on Ethics and seminars on legitimacy, Kant, a Univeral Basic Income and other topics in political philosophy.
