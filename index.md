# Philipp Stehr

I am a political philosopher interested in the economy and economics. I am currently writing a dissertation at Utrecht University on business corporations and democracy.

## Dissertation project

Business corporations hold an enormous amount of power towards employees, contractors, customers, and the general public without any democratic control. This runs contrary to basic democratic convictions, so the democratization of business corporations is called for. In my thesis I explore several questions related to this project of democratization. What exactly does it mean to democratize a business corporation? Who should be involved and what kinds of institutional changes are democratic? How can we develop feasible institutional proposals for democratic business corporations? What are feasible institutional proposals and what does 'feasible' even mean in the context of such a fundamental change to our economic infrastructure?
