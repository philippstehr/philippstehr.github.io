# Resources for students

*This is an incomplete and idiosyncratic list. It merely contains what I found helpful or what I think can be helpful to others.*

## Content

There are important specialized places for academic philosophical content on the web. To find overview and introductory articles you should consult the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/) or [Philosophy Compass](https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17479991).

To find articles and books on more specific topics, you should look on [PhilPapers](https://philpapers.org/).

## Software

There are many helpful pieces of software that make doing/writing philosophy easier. I am strongly in favour of using non-commercial and open-source products wherever possible.

I do all my writing in non-[WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editors. That helps me to concentrate on the content instead of getting distracted by formatting. I use a simple editor and the markdown format for short writing and presentations. The great [pandoc converter](https://pandoc.org/) can make markdown files into basically anything else. I write articles in the .tex format using the editor [Kile](https://kile.sourceforge.io/). Kile then makes good-looking .pdf files, the most practical format for sharing documents.

Anybody who ever has to cite something in a piece of writing should use a reference manager. I manage my literature with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). It exports automatically into .bib files with the BetterBibTeX extension. Those files can be used in .md and .tex files. Extensions for all kinds of office suites are also available.
